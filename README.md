## Building

To build the `crbot` tool without a cloned repo (assuming that `$GOPATH/bin` is
in your `$PATH`):

```bash
$ go install github.com/google/code-review-bot/cmd/crbot@latest
$ crbot [options]
```

Or, from a cloned repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/google/code-review-bot.git
$ cd code-review-bot
$ go build ./cmd/crbot
$ ./crbot [options]
```

## Developing

Install the `mockgen` tool from [GoMock](https://github.com/golang/mock):

```bash
$ go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.6.0
```

Generate the mocks:

```bash
$ go generate ./...
```

This specific version of the `mockgen` tool is what's used in this repo, and
tests will fail if your version generates different code, including comments.

To update the version of the tools used in this repo:

1. update the version number in this file (above) as well as in
   [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml) and
   [`go.mod`](go.mod) (see entry for `github.com/golang/mock`) to match â€”
   note that you should use the same version for `mockgen` as for the
   `github.com/golang/mock` repo to ensure they're mutually-consistent
1. run `go mod tidy` to update the `go.sum` file
1. run the updated `go install` command above to get newer version of `mockgen`
1. run the `go generate` command above to regenerate the mocks
1. [run the tests](#testing) from the top-level of the tree
1. commit your changes to this file (`README.md`), `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and
   `main.yml`, making sure that the build passes on GitHub Actions before
   merging the change

## Testing

Just what you might expect:

```bash
$ make test
```
